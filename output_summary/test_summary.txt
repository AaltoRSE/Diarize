 The speaker discusses implementing quicksort GPU dot CC, extending it for multiple GPUs using distributed quicksort, allocating one process per device for each node, efficiently utilizing hardware, avoiding single CPU threads or devices in tasks three and four. Another speaker is working on an open-source toolkit called Pie Audio Speaker Diorization Toolkit that uses PyTorch machine learning framework and can be fine-tuned to improve performance on their own data.
